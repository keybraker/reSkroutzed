## Why use reSkroutzed?

Skroutz has been using dark patterns to mislead consumers into purchasing sponsored products (advertisements). The purpose of this extension is to make it easier for consumers to identify which products are sponsored and which are not, so they can make informed purchasing decisions. It also gives the consumer the ability to hide the sponsored products if they so wish to.

Extra features include:

- Lowest price checker outside of "Buy through Skroutz"
- Product page sponsored flagging and removal
- Frequently bought together sponsored flagging and removal
- Advertisement overview inside of the popup
